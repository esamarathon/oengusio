## How to run on your computer

### Requirements

#### Setup

A docker image is hosted on docker hub https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/oengusio/backend

On PostgreSQL, create a database named `oengus`

Fill the following fields and add them to your environment variables (can be done locally with your favourite IDE). For Discord/Twitch/Twitter, only one of them is required so you can login. We recommend using [Discord](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia/wiki/Setting-up-a-Discord-application) since it's the easiest to setup
